# Welcome!
~~~<span style="color:gray  ">25, Sept. 2021</span>~~~


Hello from my new blog inteded to post `Pluto.jl` based  notebooks. In addition I will have blog post that are written in markdown and use `Franklin.jl`. For example we can write julia code as:

```julia:./welcome
println("Hello!")
```

which is evaluated:

\output{./welcome}

## Details

The majority of the blog post will be based around small projects I'm doing on my spare personal time related to physics, materials science, and machine learning. I anticipate most blogs being written using `Pluto.jl`
